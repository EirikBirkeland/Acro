# Acro

I wrote this collection of scripts in 2014-2015. It was one of my first projects as a professional developer.

At the time, I was translating documents for a large end-client, and this end-client supplied a large bundle of multi-lingual glossaries. These glossary files had too many fails and could not be imported directly into ApSIC's Xbench.

At first, I tried using some standard CSV tools for creating subsets of the giant CSV files, however I was unable to achieve the intended result.

So, I decided to dig deeper, and I spent a day or so figuring out the idiosyncracies of the CSV files (not quite standard-compliant ...) and cleanly parsed the data and then generated appropriate output files.

These files were used by myself and several members on my team.
