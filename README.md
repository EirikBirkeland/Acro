# Acro

I wrote this collection of scripts in 2014-2015. It was one of my first projects as a professional developer.

At the time, I was translating documents for a large end-client, and this end-client supplied a large bundle of multi-lingual glossary files in CSV format. It turned out that these glossary files had too many fields and could not be imported directly into ApSIC's Xbench.

At first, I tried using some standard CSV tools for creating subsets of the giant CSV files, however I was unable to achieve the intended result using standard tools.

So, I decided to dig deeper, and I spent a few days figuring out the idiosyncracies of the CSV files – which turned out to be anything but standards-compliant – and in the same time I wrote a custom CSV parser which cleanly parsed the data and then generated appropriate output files.

These files were used by myself and several members on my team. This little project was one of several projects that helped me discover my passion for programming.
