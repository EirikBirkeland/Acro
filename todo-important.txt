1. Either I pre-process all csv's by removing embedded newlines (already made), or 
2. I post-process everything separately.

 1 is basically done, but the next steps do not like the output provided by Python

SHORTCUT: since it is the uniq routine that messes it up, need only avoid it for now, even if it retains all the annoying duplicates.
